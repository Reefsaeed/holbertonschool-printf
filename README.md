# _printf - Custom printf Implementation

This project is a custom implementation of the printf function in C, recreated from scratch as part of the Holberton School curriculum.

## Description
The `_printf` function produces output according to a format string and returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings). This implementation handles the basic conversion specifiers required for the project.
